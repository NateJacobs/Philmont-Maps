    "description": "This Valle Vidal itinerary will enable you to see an incredible assortment of wildlife, enormous grass filled vegas, healthy ponderosa pine stands, and rugged mountains to the north of Philmont. You will also have the opportunity to let pack burros carry a portion of your gear! Start your trek with thought provoking initiative games and challenge course events that will bring your crew together at Dan Beard. From there, you will help our staff with an important search and rescue mission at Seally Canyon. Navigate your crew over the north ridge and visit the historic Ring Place before riding some of the best mountain biking trails in northern New Mexico at Whiteman Vega. Work on a trail project with the Conservation Department and preview your Baldy Mountain ascent from the meadow on the north end of McCrystal Creek, as it's view is an unparalleled experience. Enjoy the serenity of Iris Park and Greenwood Canyon before continuing south back onto Philmont property. Take time to review all of the ground you covered in the Valle Vidal from Baldy’s northern ridgeline and peak! Visit French Henry and explore Lucien Maxwell’s gold producing Aztec Mine and historic Baldy Town. Shoot booming .50 caliber black powder rifles and pick up burros at Miranda before camping at Baldy Skyline for the night. Enjoy the hike down the South Ponil Canyon or along Dean Skyline before dropping off your burros and capping off your trek at Ponil. Cowboy Action Shooting, boot branding, roping, a chuckwagon dinner, cantina show, horse rides, and a cowboy breakfast will leave your crew with amazing memories of their trek just before making their triumphant return to Base Camp!",
