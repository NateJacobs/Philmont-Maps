    "description": "This Valle Vidal itinerary will enable your crew to see an incredible assortment of wildlife, enjoy enormous grass filled vegas, hike through beautiful ponderosa pine stands, and view the rugged mountains to the north of Philmont! You will also have the opportunity to let pack burros carry a portion of your gear! Start off by seeing the world’s only confirmed T-Rex track and tour the fascinating petroglyphs left by the ancient Ancestral Puebloan people at Indian Writings. Work on a trail project with the Conservation Department before taking part in a search and rescue at Seally Canyon. You will then visit the historic Ring Place for folk weather forecasting and then make your way to Whiteman Vega to ride some of the best mountain biking trails in northern New Mexico. Hike west across the mesa to visit the ruins at the top of McCrystal Creek, where you will enjoy an unparalleled opportunity view Philmont's skyline from the northern meadow. Hike through Beatty Lakes on your way to Dan Beard for initiative games and challenge events that will bring your crew together. Next, enjoy Cowboy Action Shooting, branding, roping, a chuckwagon dinner, cantina show, horse rides, and a cowboy breakfast at Ponil! Pick up pack burros and you'll be off to climb spar poles with the Continental Tie and Lumber Company at Pueblano. You'll also learn to cut cross ties and enjoy the music and stories at their Company Meeting Campfire. From there, make your way to the two day Mountain Man Rendezvous at Miranda. You’ll shoot booming .50 caliber black powder rifles, side hike Baldy Mountain, and visit historic Baldy Town. The last night at Santa Claus will give your crew a special opportunity to watch the sunset and reflect on the journey and everything that they have accomplished together. Hike down to Bear Canyon turnaround and you'll be Base Camp bound!",
